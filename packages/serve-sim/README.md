# serve-sim

The `npx serve` of Apple Simulators.

Host your simulator for use with Agent tools like Codex, Cursor, or Claude Desktop — locally, over your LAN, or host on a remote mac and tunnel anywhere.

```sh
npx serve-sim
# → Preview at http://localhost:3200
```

`serve-sim` spawns a small Swift helper that captures the simulator's framebuffer via `simctl io`, exposes it as an MJPEG stream + WebSocket control channel, and serves a React preview UI on top. It works with any booted iOS Simulator — no Xcode plugin, no instrumentation in your app.

## Features

- Full 60 FPS video stream in the browser.
- Swipe from the bottom to go home.
- gestures like pinch to zoom by holding the option key.
- Simulator logs are forwarded to the browser for browser-use MCP tools to read from.
- Recent simulator actions are available in the browser tools panel and `serve-sim event-log`.
- Drag and drop videos and images to add them to the simulator device.
- Keyboard commands and hot keys are forwarded to the simulator, including CMD+SHIFT+H to go home.
- Apple Watch, iPad, and iOS support.

## Why?

Hosted simulators can be hard to test, `serve-sim` enables you to test the hosted infra locally first for faster iteration. When you're ready to host a simulator remotely, simply tunnel the served URL and users can interact with the simulator as if it were running locally on their device.

I develop the Expo framework, but this tool is completely agnostic to React Native and can be used for any iOS interaction you need.

## Install

Requires macOS with Xcode command line tools (`xcrun simctl`) and a [maintained Node.js LTS release](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases) (currently Node 20+). Older or end-of-life Node versions are not supported. `bun` is **not** required to run the CLI. Camera injection uses a host-side helper built for macOS 14+.

> **Note:** Apple Silicon (arm64) only. The bundled `serve-sim-bin` helper ships as an arm64 binary and does not run on Intel (x86_64) Macs.

> **Xcode 27 keyboard input:** Device Hub must be running with the target simulator window visible and frontmost. macOS may also require the app that launched `serve-sim` (for example Terminal) to be enabled in **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility**. Xcode 26 and older keep using the legacy simulator HID path. Set `SERVE_SIM_DISABLE_DEVICE_HUB_KEYBOARD=1` to opt out of the Xcode 27 bridge.

## iPhone Duo

With Xcode 27.1 and the iOS 27.1 runtime, the preview exposes **Folded**,
**Semi-folded**, and **Fully open** controls for iPhone Duo. Selecting one drives
the simulator's hinge and follows the active panel's framebuffer. Touches use the panel's own
integrated digitizer; volume and power controls use a guest HID service.

```sh
serve-sim fold 0 -d <udid>
serve-sim fold 180 -d <udid>      # flat, 180°
serve-sim fold 130 -d <udid>      # 130°
serve-sim fold 100 -d <udid>
```

Commands wait for the guest to acknowledge dispatch. Invalid angles and failed
commands do not change capture. The bundled `simduo/serve-sim-duo-hid` executable
runs inside the simulator and exits with the device session.

Duo uses one interactive RealityKit preview of the installed Xcode model, with
live screen textures and touches mapped to each bent screen half. Apple's model
stays in Xcode; it is not redistributed. Rotate animates the device and pose
icons together. Motion uses a faster 1000×900 render target and sharpens once to 1500×1350 when settled.
Screenshots capture the active app framebuffer, including the unfolded inner display.

Use the pose buttons or hold **Alt** to reveal the continuous hinge slider.
Pinch gestures do not fold the device.
Power, camera, and volume controls follow the device's physical edges, fade in
when the cursor is nearby, and stay hidden during pose animation. They support
press-and-hold. The main control bar has no volume menu or 2D/3D mode toggle.

See the [feature contract and regression checklist](../../.agents/skills/serve-sim-duo-verification/references/expected-behavior.md)
for appearance, folding, rotation, controls, screenshot, and performance checks.

The preview follows hinge changes made in Device Hub. Closed (0°), Tent (80°),
Table (100°), Book (130°), and Open (180°) are angle presets; use Rotate for
orientation. SpringBoard primary-display events choose the captured panel,
including intermediate poses that depend on whether you were opening or closing.
Until guest readback arrives, a 90° threshold provides the initial fallback.
The runtime decides which intermediate poses apps adopt.

Xcode 27 Device Hub can disconnect legacy touch/keyboard services. If input
stops working, run `serve-sim repair-input -d <udid>`. **This restarts SpringBoard
and closes running apps.** Restart serve-sim afterward to reconnect guest HID
services, then reopen your app. This repair is explicit, never automatic.

If Device Hub is stuck on “Connecting display…” and `xcrun simctl io <udid>
enumerate` lists no framebuffer ports, streaming cannot start until the simulator's
display connection is restored. Duo relies on private beta APIs and the selected
Xcode's `V68.usdz` model; compatibility must be rechecked after SDK updates.

```

Multiple booted simulators are supported — pass several device names, or leave it empty to attach to all of them.

### Camera

`serve-sim camera <bundle-id>` replaces the simulator's camera feed for a single app. A small host-side helper writes BGRA frames into a POSIX shared-memory region; an injected dylib (`DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`) swizzles AVFoundation inside the simulator process so the app reads from that region instead of the simulator's stub camera.

The helper is one-per-device and outlives any single app launch, so multiple apps on the same simulator can share the feed — just run `serve-sim camera <other-bundle-id>` again to relaunch the next app with the dylib attached. Source changes (`camera switch`) and mirror changes (`camera mirror`) flow through the helper's control socket and don't relaunch the app.

Sources:

- **placeholder** — animated programmatic frames (default).
- **file** — image (PNG/JPEG/HEIC/…) or video (mp4/mov/m4v/webm/…). The CLI sniffs the kind from the extension and falls back to magic bytes for files without an extension.
- **webcam** — live `AVCaptureDevice` (built-in, Continuity, external).

## Connectors

`serve-sim` can be used with dev servers, browser, and AI editors for more seamless integration.

### Agent Skill

An [Agent Skill](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview) ships in [`skills/serve-sim`](skills/serve-sim) — it teaches AI coding agents (Grok, Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, and any host implementing the open Agent Skills standard) how to drive a simulator through the CLI: taps, gestures, hardware buttons, rotation, camera injection, and handing the stream off to the host's preview pane.

```sh
bunx add-skill EvanBacon/serve-sim
# in Claude Code:
/plugin marketplace add EvanBacon/serve-sim
```

See [`skills/serve-sim/README.md`](skills/serve-sim/README.md) for the full capability list.

### Claude Code Desktop

Create a `.claude/launch.json` and define a server:

```json
{
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Apple",
      "runtimeExecutable": "npx",
      "runtimeArgs": ["serve-sim"],
      "port": 3200
    }
  ]
}
```

### Expo

Automatically start the serve-sim process with `npx expo start` and access the URL at `http://localhost:8081/.sim`.

First, customize the `metro.config.js` file (`bunx expo customize`):

```js
// Learn more https://docs.expo.io/guides/customizing-metro
const { getDefaultConfig } = require("expo/metro-config");
const connect = require("connect");
const { simMiddleware } = require("serve-sim/middleware");

/** @type {import('expo/metro-config').MetroConfig} */
const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

config.server = config.server || {};
const originalEnhanceMiddleware = config.server.enhanceMiddleware;
config.server.enhanceMiddleware = (metroMiddleware, server) => {
  const middleware = originalEnhanceMiddleware
    ? originalEnhanceMiddleware(metroMiddleware, server)
    : metroMiddleware;
  const app = connect();
  app.use(simMiddleware({ basePath: "/.sim" }));
  app.use(middleware);
  return app;
};

module.exports = config;
```

## Embed in your dev server

`serve-sim/middleware` is a Connect-style middleware that mounts the same preview UI inside your existing dev server (Metro, Vite, Next, plain Express, etc.). Add the middleware:

```ts
import { simMiddleware } from "serve-sim/middleware";

app.use(simMiddleware({ basePath: "/.sim" }));
// → preview HTML at /.sim
// → state JSON  at /.sim/api
```

The page reaches the stream, the input socket and WebKit DevTools through the middleware's own same-origin `/.sim/helper/<device>` and `/.sim/devtools` routes. Video and the tools work with a plain `app.use(...)`; simulator input and DevTools use WebSockets, so forward your server's `upgrade` events to `handleUpgrade`:

```ts
const middleware = simMiddleware({ basePath: "/.sim" });
app.use(middleware);

const server = app.listen(3000);
server.on("upgrade", (req, socket, head) =>
  middleware.handleUpgrade(req, socket, head),
);
```

When terminating TLS at a reverse proxy, forward `X-Forwarded-Proto` so the helper URLs use `https`/`wss` and avoid mixed-content blocks.

## Security model

serve-sim controls a simulator and runs commands on your Mac, so it treats every web page other than its own as hostile, even though it only listens on `127.0.0.1` by default:

- **Host allowlist.** Requests and WebSocket upgrades must name `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` or `[::1]` on the bound port in their `Host` header; anything else gets `403`. This is what stops DNS-rebinding attacks. To reach the preview under another name (a tunnel, a reverse proxy), pass `--allowed-host <host>` (repeatable), or `allowedHosts` to the middleware. `--host 0.0.0.0` additionally accepts the machine's own addresses and hostname.
- **Same-origin only.** WebSocket upgrades and state-changing requests must come from the preview's own origin (or from a non-browser client, which sends no `Origin`). No route sends CORS headers, so other sites cannot read the screen, the accessibility tree or the config.
- **Session token.** Simulator input, device start/shutdown, DevTools and host commands require a per-process token that is delivered only inside the preview HTML — never by `/api`. The `serve-sim tap|gesture|button|…` commands read it from a file in `$TMPDIR/serve-sim/` that only your user can open.
- **No shell.** The page can only run the specific commands its tools need (`simctl` actions for the selected simulator, the `serve-sim camera|permissions|rotate|button` subcommands, staging dropped files under `/tmp`). They are executed without a shell. `--unsafe-exec` (middleware: `unsafeExec: true`) restores arbitrary shell commands for setups that depend on it; leave it off otherwise.
- **DevTools bridge.** The WebKit inspector bridge listens on `127.0.0.1` only, refuses browser origins, and is started only by an authenticated request.

Binding to a non-loopback address (`--host 0.0.0.0`) hands all of this to anyone who can reach the port: they can load the page, and the token with it. Only do that on a network you trust.

Embedding note: earlier versions pointed the page straight at a `serve-sim --detach` helper's port, relying on wide-open CORS and an unauthenticated input socket. That mode is gone; `proxyHelpers` is accepted but no longer has any effect.

```

The Swift helper (`bin/serve-sim-bin`) is a tiny standalone binary — no Xcode dependency at runtime. The CLI embeds it via `bun build --compile`, so installing the npm package is enough.

## Development

```sh
bun install
bun run --filter serve-sim build         # build the JS bundles
bun run --filter serve-sim build:swift   # rebuild the Swift helper
bun run --filter serve-sim dev           # watch mode
```
